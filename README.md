# TreeExtra
Additive Groves, bagged trees with feature evaluation, interaction detection, feature effect visualization

This is a development version of the TreeExtra package. You can find early releases, detailed manuals and related research papers and talks on http://additivegroves.net . If I decide there are enough changes to warrant next release, I'll make a proper release here on GitHub.
